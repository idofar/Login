add react part:
https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-create-a-react--flask-project
1. create react project.
2. add to package.json: "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
   so to redirect any requests it receives on its port 3000 that it does not
   understand into another server.
3. yarn manages the react appliaction. add the flask server to be managed with
   yarn:
   add to package.json in the "scripts" section right after "start":
   "start-api": "cd api && venv/bin/flask run --no-debugger",
